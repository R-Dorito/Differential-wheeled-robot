P = 1.75 and 2
I = 0.3
D = 0.7

Why is it that these poles produce a value that has only real numbers?
Well, they are not oscillating.

How do we get these values? 
(1+Kd​)s2+Kp​s+Ki​=0

The other reason is due to the quadratic equation, s= (−b ± sqrt(b^2−4ac)) / 2

​​Where:
b^2 − 4ac > 0 then theres only real numbers and no oscillation
b^2 − 4ac = 0, double poles, neutral system
b^2 − 4ac < 0 then its underdamped and its going to go out of control. 
Two poles exist above and below the imaginary line axis

Note, the system is more stable when poles move away from the central (jw) axis.
